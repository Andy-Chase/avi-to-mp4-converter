## Installation

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher if not already installed.
2. Install the moviepy library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install moviepy


3. Install FFmpeg:

- For Mac:
  1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already. Follow the instructions on the official website: https://brew.sh/
  2. Install FFmpeg using Homebrew. Run the following command in Terminal:
     ```
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```

- For Windows:
  1. Download the FFmpeg executable from the official website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
  2. Extract the downloaded archive to a folder (e.g., C:\ffmpeg)

## Usage

1. Edit the Python script, specifically the following lines:

- Set the path to the FFmpeg executable:
  ```
  os.environ["IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE"] = "/path/to/ffmpeg"
  ```

- Set the path to the input folder containing your AVI files:
  ```
  input_folder = "/path/to/input/folder"
  ```

2. Run the script using a terminal or command prompt:

The script will create an output folder in the same location as the input folder with " MP4" added to the end. All converted videos will be saved in this folder.
